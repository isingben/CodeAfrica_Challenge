- I use Visual studio code editor
-  Once you reach to my repository here clone it to specific folder
-  Whenever you reach to my folder open it and you'll see basic file called index.html you will open it in browser you want(This is for UI)
-  For javascript it requires you to install extension of code runner and node.js to run javascript file ,
-  Once it is installed you will click run button on top of the Javascript file to see the output
